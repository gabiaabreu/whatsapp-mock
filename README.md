## HTML and CSS: WhatsApp Mock

This project was made with the intent of practicing my semantic HTML and CSS skills.  

It's an old project, I have improved my habilites since then, but I'm still proud of it!

It doesn't use any programming languages so it's not that interactive.

### How to run it
Clone this repo and open the .html file on your browser
